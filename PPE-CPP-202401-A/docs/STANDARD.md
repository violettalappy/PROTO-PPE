# BAD PRACTICE
Do not use ENUM, it is just abitrary number assignment increment

# Prefix Practice
- DO NOT USE DEFINE, it is global for every script that include in compiler system, using constant variable member in local class
- K for constant of define, for more easily access
- arg_ for argument variable in function, to differentiate than most variables
- _ (can be replaced with m_) for private variables
- Variable (just name as CamelCase, with proper s for array stuffs) (can be replaced with g_) for public variables
